# Overwatch_RPG

This is a basic RPG game. You choose your chacter and your enemy to see who will win the battle. If you win, then you fight your next opponent. If you lose, then you have to restart. There currently is a bug where the hero you choose does not increase its power after you win a game and I have the hit points set too low in ratio with the character's health. 

The game is Overwatched themed using photos, characters, fonts, in game audio, and color schemes from the game.
